# About this nvim config

This is based on nvim-kickstart and just a basic learning curve for me on how to configure neovim as well as continously improve on using neovim and vim motions.

## Primary changes

So far changes are relatively small and mostly consist of uncommenting certain parts, but also contain a configuration in order to use dotnet format for C#.
